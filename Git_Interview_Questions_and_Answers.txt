Git Interview Questions and Answers
===================================

ðŸ”¹ BASIC GIT QUESTIONS

1. What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate, manage changes, and maintain the history of code revisions.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
- Git is a version control tool used locally to manage code.
- GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration features like pull requests and issue tracking.

3. What is a Git repository?
A Git repository is a .git folder inside a project directory that stores all version history, branches, and configuration for the project.

4. Whatâ€™s the difference between a local and a remote repository?
- Local repository is on your computer (your working directory and .git folder).
- Remote repository is hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

5. How do you check the current Git branch?
git branch


ðŸ”¹ INTERMEDIATE GIT QUESTIONS

6. What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`?
- `git fetch`: Downloads changes from the remote repository without merging them.
- `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository into your current branch.

7. How do you resolve a Git merge conflict?
1. Open the conflicting file.
2. Edit the sections marked by Git (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
3. Save the changes.
4. Add the file: git add <filename>
5. Commit the merge: git commit

8. What is a Git branch? Why is it used?
A Git branch allows you to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment without affecting the main codebase. It's used for isolating development work.

9. What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?
- `git merge`: Combines changes into a single commit with a possible merge commit.
- `git rebase`: Re-applies commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history.

10. How do you undo a commit that has been pushed to the remote repo?
Use `git revert <commit-hash>` to create a new commit that undoes the previous one.
(This is preferred over `git reset` for shared/public repositories.)


ðŸ”¹ ADVANCED GIT QUESTIONS

11. How do you squash commits in Git?
git rebase -i HEAD~n
- Replace `pick` with `squash` for commits you want to merge.
- Save and edit the commit message.

12. What is the `.gitignore` file?
It lists files and directories Git should ignore (not track), like log files, temp files, or compiled binaries.

13. How can you view commit history?
git log
For more details: git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all

14. What are Git tags?
Tags are used to mark specific points in history, typically for releases (e.g., v1.0).
git tag v1.0  
git push origin v1.0

15. What is the stash in Git?
`git stash` temporarily saves your changes without committing, allowing you to switch branches.
git stash  
git stash pop
